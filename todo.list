- Infinite loop on server side missing?
- sendto: Invalid argument? (Review your sendto call!)
- TCP EVERYTHING
- maybe some debug printf statements?
- see what the ip address is actually getting inserted as (wrong order?)
- REMEMBER TO RENAME SHIT AT THE END
- maybe a waiting thread? depends on how i'm feeling
